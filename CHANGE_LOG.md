# KSP-Recall :: Change Log

* 2020-0304: 0.0.2.2 (LisiasT) for [1.9.0 <= KSP <= 1.9.1] PRE-RELEASE
	+ Allowing Fuel Switches that eliminates all the Resources from a part to be protected
	+ Embedding KSPe.Light (avoiding an external dependency).
* 2020-0303: 0.0.2.1 (LisiasT) for [1.9.0 <= KSP <= 1.9.1] PRE-RELEASE
	+ ** DROPPED ** 
* 2020-0302: 0.0.2.0 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.4.1 PRE-RELEASE
	+ A not so initial Release for Evaluation, but really made right this time. Honest!
	+ Correctly (I think) implements the Issue [#1](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSP-Recall/issues/3) "KSP 1.9.x resets resources to prefab while cloning parts".
		- Listening to the new Event `OnPartResourceChanged`
	+ Fixes the Issue [#2](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSP-Recall/issues/2) "Resourceful is applying the last scaling of a part on every new part"
* 2020-0301: 0.0.1.1 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.4.1 PRE-RELEASE
	+ Initial Release for Evaluation made right this time.
* 2020-0301: 0.0.1.0 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.4.1 PRE-RELEASE
	+ Initial Release for Evaluation
	+ Currently compatible only with TweakScale
